    "Curse of Dimensionality:\n",
    "    The curse of dimensionality refers to the challenges and issues that arise when dealing with high-dimensional data. \n",

    "    This can lead to several problems, including increased sparsity of data points, increased computational complexity, and challenges in model generalization.\n",
    "Overfitting:\n",
    "    Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations as if they were genuine patterns. \n",
    "    In high-dimensional spaces, models have a greater capacity to fit the training data precisely, potentially capturing noise and outliers, which may not generalize\n",
    "    well to new, unseen data.\n",
    "Underfitting:\n",
    "    Underfitting happens when a model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data. \n",
    "    In the context of the curse of dimensionality, underfitting may occur when a model is unable to discern complex relationships among high-dimensional features, \n",
    "    leading to poor performance on both the training and test datasets.\n",
    "Relation:\n",
    "    The curse of dimensionality exacerbates the risk of overfitting. \n",
    "    With a high-dimensional feature space, models can become too complex, fitting the noise in the training data rather than the true underlying patterns. \n",
    "    The curse of dimensionality makes it easier for models to find spurious correlations in the training data, which may not hold in general.\n",
    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "    Careful feature selection is another strategy to combat overfitting.\n",
    "    By choosing relevant features and discarding irrelevant or redundant ones, the effective dimensionality of the problem is reduced, making it less prone to \n",
