    "    A common metric used to decide on the number of principal components is the \"explained variance.\" \n",
    "    The cumulative sum of the eigenvalues divided by the total sum gives the proportion of variance explained by each principal component.\n",

    "    Choosing too few principal components may result in underfitting, where important patterns in the data are not captured. \n",
