    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique that aims to reduce overfitting in decision trees through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap Sampling: \n",
    "    Bagging involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset by randomly sampling with replacement (bootstrap sampling).\n",
    "    Each subset is used to train a separate decision tree.\n",
    "    Since each tree is trained on a slightly different subset of the data, it introduces diversity into the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Feature Selection: \n",
    "    For each decision tree in the ensemble, a random subset of features is considered at each split. \n",
    "    This helps prevent individual trees from becoming too specialized to the training data, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Averaging or Voting: \n",
    "    In the case of regression tasks, the final prediction is often the average of predictions from individual trees. \n",
    "    For classification tasks, it could be a majority vote. \n",
    "    Combining the predictions of multiple trees helps in smoothing out the noise and reducing the impact of outliers."
