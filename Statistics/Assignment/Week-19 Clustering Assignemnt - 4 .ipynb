    "        Silhouette Coefficients range from -1 to 1.\n",
    "        A high positive value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.\n",
    "        A value near 0 indicates overlapping clusters.\n",
    "        A negative value suggests that the object might be assigned to the wrong cluster.\n",
    "    Sensitivity to Cluster Shape:\n",
    "        Silhouette Coefficient might not perform well with non-convex or elongated clusters.\n",
    "        It assumes clusters are convex and isotropic.\n",
    "    Sensitivity to Density:\n",
